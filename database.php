                <p>This major research project had four principle goals: to establish the succession to Domesday fees,
                    to establish the provenance (Norman or other, including English) of the first fee-holder, and to
                    provide a prosopographical register of all persons occurring in English administrative documents
                    written in the century after the Norman Conquest. The full Latin texts of over 4000 documents are
                    included in the database and integrally linked to analysis about over the 9000 persons, and their
                    families, who occur in them. Query and search facilites make easy work of finding, cross-referencing
                    and interrogating a wealth of detail, as do visual aids such as dynamic family trees.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project has resulted in the publication of three essential reference books: K. S. B. Keats-Rohan
                    and David E. Thornton (compilers.), Domesday Names: An Index of Latin Personal and Place Names in
                    Domesday Book (Woodbridge: Boydell Press, 1997, reprinted 2007) ISBN: 0851154298.

                    The COEL database forms an essential complement to the books, which it eclipses in wealth of detail
                    and functionality. The database provides a rapid index facility for the tens of thousand of names
                    and other data in the books. It provides in addition the Latin texts on which the English
                    commentaries were based, family trees, full Latin and English text searching, querying and more
                    besides. The editable version enables a user to add his/her own files to the database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The COEL database 2nd edn. is now available on CD in two versions, an uneditable browser version and
                    a fully editable version which will permit the user to make additions to his copy of the database.
                    Both versions are available in single- and multi-user licence format.
                </p>
