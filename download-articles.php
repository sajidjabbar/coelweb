                            Three-part essay which first looks in depth at the relationship between prosopography and
                            biography, showing that the use of the term ‘collective biography’ is misconceived. As part
                            of its investigation into a group whose members share one or more attribute, prosopography
                            concerns itself with the individuals making up the group. The associated questions of
                            identification and identity are discussed, linked to an examination of issues of names and
                            naming and the importance of context. The essay concludes with worked examples based upon an
                            online tutorial <a href="">http://prosopography.modhist.ox.ac.uk</a>.

                            settlers as these manifested themselves most notably in the civil wars of Stephen’s reign,

                        <p>
                            From a twelfth-century perspective, the honour of Wallingford appears to be a typical Norman
                            institution.<br>
                            However, a re-examination of its constituent parts indicates that through marriage it was
                            largely derived from the lands of Wigod of Wallingford and his family. Wigod appears to
                            have been one of Edward the Confessor’s stallers and the estates that he held were what was
                            effectively a pre-conquest ‘castlery’ with distant origins in a period before the formation
                            of the county of Berkshire. Throughout its history the honour was to remain under the tight
                            control of the crown, reflecting its strategic role in the defence of the middle Thames
                            valley.
